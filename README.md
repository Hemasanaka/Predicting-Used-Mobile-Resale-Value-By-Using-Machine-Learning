# Predicting-Used-Mobile-Resale-Value-By-Using-Machine-Learning
Simba Mobiles, a newly established store specializing in used mobile devices sourced from wholesale markets, aims to optimize business operations through machine learning algorithms. To achieve this, the company embarked on building two predictive models and conducting clustering analysis.The first predictive model, a backward stepwise linear regression, was selected as the optimal approach for predicting the normalized used price of mobile devices. Leveraging this model's capability to identify important features, Simba Mobiles can make informed pricing decisions to maximize profitability.Second predictive model, a decision tree classifier was chosen to categorize mobile devices as having either high or low resale value in the market. By considering various device features, this model provides valuable insights for inventory management and sales strategies.Additionally, clustering analysis was performed to discern patterns among mobile devices and group similar ones together. A subsequent classification clustering model aids in identifying which cluster a mobile device belongs to base on its features, facilitating efficient restocking decisions. Key performance metrics, including predicted normalized used price, predicted resale value, and predicted cluster, serve as vital indicators for business decision-making. By leveraging these metrics, Simba Mobiles gains insights into market trends and optimizes investment strategies, ultimately driving business growth and profitability.
